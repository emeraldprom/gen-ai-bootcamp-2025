## Examples

Here are examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score and why the example is scored the way it is

<example>
   <user input>
   Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out ?
    </user input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
     - BAD: it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
     - BAD: the beginning sentence is unnnecessary, it should just jump into the table
     - BAD: in the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out
     - BAD: the sentence structure is not good, we want something that is conceptual, like this: [location] [subject] [verb],[object] [verb-past]

    <score_reasons>
    <assistant output>
    et's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible sentence structure:
Subject (Bears) + wa/ga + Verb (are) + Location (at the door) + , (comma) + Question (did you leave) + Object (the garbage) + out?
Here's a vocabulary table to help you:
Japanese	|Romaji	|English
	        |kuma	|bear
	        |tobira	|door
	        |mizu	|garbage
	        |oki    |leave
	        |iru	|exist/be
	        |naku	|cry/no (used for negation)
	        |tsukau	|use/leave (something in a certain state)
	        |aru	|exist/be (polite form)

Your turn! Try to put the sentence together using the vocabulary and sentence structure provided.
Note: Remember to think about the correct particles to use and the conjugation/tenses of the verbs.
